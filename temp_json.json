Gohan, unlike Goku, was raised as a student of education instead of fighting. However, he had to start fighting at a young age due to the Sayian invasion of Earth, first by <a href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\">Raditz</a>. Gohan was kidnapped by Raditz but broke free of his captor when his secret hidden power was released when he heard his father being harmed. After his defeat, Raditz announced two even stronger Saiyans would be coming to earth, later revealed to be <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>. <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, taking great interest in Gohan and his power, decided to train him for the upcoming fight against the Saiyans.</p><p>A year later, when the Saiyans finally arrive, Gohan joins Piccolo, <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tenshinhan</a>, <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, <a href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\">Chaozu</a>, and <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Kuririn</a> in the fight against the Saiyans. Gohan fought well against Nappa, and was so overcome with rage and sadness when Piccolo was killed by Nappa, he became a worthy opponent, to the point where Nappa began to enjoy the fight. He was quickly worn-out, however, and was about to be killed by Nappa before Goku arrived. After defeating Nappa, Goku warned Gohan and Kuririn to leave, as they would only be burdens in the fight against Nappa. They leave, but Gohan quickly rushes back as he began to worry for his father. Going back, he finds his father nearly defeated and begins to try to defeat Vegeta, who is in his ape form. <a href=\"/yajirobe/4005-45990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45990\">Yajirobe</a> cuts off Vegeta's tail, reverting him back to his normal state. After more attempts to defeat Vegeta, including the Genki-Dama, Earth's fighters are exhausted and cannot continue the fight. Remembering that Gohan is half-saiyan though, tells Gohan to look up at the artificial moon Vegeta created. Gohan transforms into a great ape, greatly scaring Vegeta. Vegeta manages to cut Gohan's tail off, but Vegeta is crushed by Gohan falling mid-transformation. Vegeta then escapes into his space-pod and leaves Earth.</p><h2>Namek/Freeza Saga</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-463935\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2222222222222\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 225px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-463935\"><img alt=\"Kid Gohan\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></a><figcaption>Kid Gohan</figcaption></figure><p>Gohan, Kuririn, and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> traveled to Namek in search of the Dragon Balls, so that they may revive their fallen friends killed in the battle against the Saiyans. But soon after arriving, they were attacked by two soldiers who destroyed their ship. Later, they ran into a Namekian village, where they caught <a href=\"/frieza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>, <a href=\"/dodoria/4005-58122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58122\">Dodoria</a>, and <a href=\"/zarbon/4005-44797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44797\">Zarbon</a> slaughtering a group of Namekians who would not tell Freeza where the Dragon Balls were. Gohan kicked Dodoria in the face, as Kuririn saved <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a>, and made a quick getaway. Gohan then runs into Vegeta and gets his power unlocked by <a href=\"/guru/4005-82201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82201\">Guru.</a> Eventually, Gohan and Kuririn decide to team up with Vegeta to battle the deadly <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a>. Gohan and Kuririn fought and struggled against <a href=\"/guldo/4005-40732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40732\">Guldo</a>, who was killed by Vegeta. Gohan then fought and was defeated by <a href=\"/recoome/4005-40736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40736\">Recoome</a>. Soon after, he witnessed his father's arrival on Namek, and him defeating Recoome, <a href=\"/burter/4005-45718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45718\">Burter</a>, and <a href=\"/jeice/4005-40735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40735\">Jeice</a>. Gohan was also the first to notice that <a href=\"/captain-ginyu/4005-40734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40734\">Ginyu</a> had switched bodies with his father Goku, and bravely fought against Ginyu, even though he was in his father's body.</p><p>Right after, Gohan and Kuririn summoned the Namekian Dragon and wished that Piccolo would be revived from the dead, and that he would be transported to Namek. Dende later points out, to Gohan and Kuririn's terror, that wishing him to Namek does only that, and teleports him to a random place on Namek. Gohan, Kuririn, and Vegeta fight against Freeza. Gohan witnesses the impaling of Kuririn by Freeza, and fights in anger against Freeza. he also witnessed Freeza murdering <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a>, contributed to Goku's Genki-Dama against Freeza, and witnessed his father's first Super Saiyan transformation. After being told to return to the ship by his father, he does and gets wished back to Earth. There he spends time with the Namekians as they take a long-stay vacation, and in an anime-only filler scene, fights Vegeta and is beaten, for the honor of his father. He also gets very emotional when Dende gets wished back to Namek. He also wonders why Goku has not returned, when it is revealed that he is alive and he survived Namek's explosion. He faced many threats, including Vegeta, the <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a> and the evil tyrant <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Frieza</a>. Once again, Gohan showed his awesome power against one of the most powerful fighters in the universe. Gohan was wished back to Earth and escaped Namek's destruction.</p><h2>Trunks Saga</h2><p>Gohan was one of the first to notice/be alerted of Freeza's presence during his return to Earth.

When the day came when <a href=\"/android-19/4005-40813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40813\">19</a> and <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">20</a> did attack, Gohan witnessed his father fight 19. He and Trunks were also the first to discover <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a>'s molted shell. Eventually, Goku recovered from his heart disease, and trained with Gohan in the Room of Spirit and Time. Inside, Gohan transformed into a Super Saiyan for the first time, and learned how to remain transformed at all times. Gohan decided with his father Goku that they were not going to take their second day in the Room. Gohan spent the majority of the ten days before the Cell Games transformed as a Super Saiyan, as he was trying to lessen the strain of the transformation. He watched his father fight Cell in the opening round of the Cell Games, and Goku, knowing Gohan's destructive power when angered, decided to forfeit the match and have Gohan take his place. For a good part of the beginning of the fight, Gohan was not faring that well against Cell. After revealing to Cell what he thought his father's plan was, Cell decided to try to anger Gohan, creating <a href=\"/cell-jr/4005-52302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52302\">Cell Jr</a>.s to defeat his friends, and attacking Gohan even harder. After 16 had his body blown off by Cell, he convinced <a href=\"/hercule/4005-46397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46397\">Mr. Satan</a> to throw his head over to Gohan to give him some words of encouragement. After 16's head was stomped on, Gohan's anger caused him to reach Super Saiyan 2.</p><p>After this, Gohan easily killed all of the Cell Jrs, and did a great deal of damage to Cell, almost killing him. Eventually, Gohan hit Cell so hard, that he threw up Android 18, reverting him back to his Imperfect Form. Cell decided that the best way to handle things was to largely grow in size and erupt in 60 seconds. Goku then decided it was best to teleport away with Cell to <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">Kaio</a> <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">-Sama's</a> planet so that the Earth will not be destroyed. Gohan began to blame himself for his father's death, claiming that if he finished Cell off when he had the chance, none of this would have ever happened. Cell appeared in the middle of the battle-field, however, shocking everyone! Cell claimed that the reason he was revived was that the nucleus in his head that allowed him to regenerate was undamaged during the explosion. He killed Trunks and revealed to Earth's fighters that he can teleport too and that his power greatly increased since he was brought back from the brink of death. In a fit of rage, Vegeta attempted to attack Cell for the death of his son. Cell quickly batted him away and tried to destroy him with an attack that Gohan blocked, causing him to lose the ability to move his arm. Cell decided to fire a Kamehameha to defeat Gohan. Gohan was not confident, however, and believed he was not able to fire a strong enough Kamehameha with one arm. Goku, from the afterlife, encouraged Gohan that he did have the strength to defeat Cell. Gohan fired his Kamehameha, and with Vegeta's help, defeated Cell. After Cell's defeat, Gohan and the others went up to <a href=\"/kami/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami's</a> lookout to wish everyone back to life. He also was the first to realize that Krillin had a crush on <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\">#18</a>.</p><h2>Majin Buu Saga</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464053\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4475\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464053\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Gohan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Gohan\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/22757/464053-146631_74596_gohan_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Gohan</figcaption></figure><p>After defeating Cell, he was next seen years later at the age of 18 attending high school, where he adopted the identity of the Great Saiyaman, fighting crime.

Even though he hadn't trained in a while, he and all the other <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z Fighters</a> joined the <a href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\">World Tournament</a>.

He reluctantly agrees, does it, and then transforms into a Super Saiyan 2, mainly for the intent of showing off. <a href=\"/spopovich/4005-56782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56782\">Spopovich</a> and <a href=\"/yamu/4005-57572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57572\">Yamu</a> then attack Gohan to try to absorb his energy for the awakening of Majin Buu. The Supreme Kai requests that Goku and Piccolo not interfere, and he restrains Gohan's energy, making him vulnerable to their attack. He is healed by Kibito, where Supreme Kai leads him, Kibito, Goku, Piccolo, and Kuririn to Babidi's spaceship. Gohan was with his father and Vegeta when they faced his minions. But Babidi used his magic to control Vegeta and this gave Babidi enough energy to resurrect <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>. When Gohan fought Majin Buu he was easily defeated by the seemingly invincible enemy.</p><p>Supreme Kai saved Gohan and took him back to his world. Gohan was able to do something no Kai had ever done, pull the Z Sword from its stone prison. He trained with the sword but when it was put to the test, it broke. Out of the sword emerged the <a href=\"/elder-kai/4005-65018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65018\">Old Supreme Kai</a>, who was able to perform a ritual that unlocked Gohan's hidden powers, making him a powerful warrior.

Gohan has also trained in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p><p>His transformation into a Super Saiyan increases his power exponentially. Toward the end of the series after training with the Old Kai, he gains the ability to transform into what is known as Mystic Gohan, also known as Ultimate Gohan, which gives him greater power than his previous Super Saiyan forms. But he can still transform multiplying his mystic power.</p><h3>Transformations</h3><h4>Oozaru (Great Ape)</h4><p>Gohan like all Saiyans can transform into a giant ape by absorbing light reflected by the Moon (Moonlight) and channeling the light through his body into his tail which triggers a natural reaction that transforms Gohan into a giant ape with blood red eyes, brown fur, and a large tail. While in his Great Ape form Gohan retains to no aspect of his personality and is extremely violent, save, brutish, mindless and virtually uncontrollable and he loses a great deal of intelligence while in this transformation. In addition, this transformation multiplies Gohan's base power by 10. If Gohan's tail is cut off while he is in this form he will revert back into his base Saiyan form and if his tail is cut off before he transforms he will be unable to transform into a Great Ape unless his tail regrows.</p><h4>Super Saiyan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864170\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864170\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Gohan, like nearly all of the Saiyans on Earth, is able to transform into a Super Saiyan multiplying his power by 50 his base power. Like all Saiyans, when Gohan is in his Super Saiyan form, his physiological attributes are dramatically increased in strength, speed and more. His energy manipulating abilities are also increased. Gohan's appearance includes upright golden hair, blue eyes, an increase in muscle mass, and a flame-like golden aura. Gohan's immune system is greatly reduced and he becomes a lot more vulnerable to diseases and this vulnerability is increased in each form after the Super Saiyan.</p><h4>Full Powered Super Saiyan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4873596\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4873596\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Gohan through intense training with Goku in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber is able to reach the physical and mental perfection of the Super Saiyan form dubbed Full Powered Super Saiyan. In the Full Powered Super Saiyan form his power and speed surpasses that of the Androids and is nearly equal to Perfect Cell's power. Gohan as a Full Powered Super Saiyan is stronger than Goku as a Full Powered Super Saiyan. This was stated by both Goku and Gohan when Goku said: \"When Cell and I were fighting did you think it was hard to keep up were we ever moving to fast for you to see\". Gohan said \"no I could see it all but that's only because you and Cell weren't fighting with your full power if you were moving as fast as you could\" Goku then says \"I don't know about Cell but I gave it my all, you thought I was holding back because you compared the energy you sensed from me to your own\".

In this form, his power is multiplied by 100. He first displayed this when he was training with Goku in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber and was knocked down. Due to emotional stress, he momentarily transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 until falling unconscious because of excess wounds during training. He later transformed fully into a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle with Cell when Cell stepped on Android 16's head while 16 was talking to Gohan whom he considered a friend. After he witnessed his friend be destroyed the emotional stress triggered the transformation into Super Saiyan 2. In this form, Gohan is stronger than Perfect Cell at full power. Gohan's last transformation into the Super Saiyan 2 was during the Majin Buu Saga when he was fighting in a World Tournament. After that day, he was never seen to transform into a Super Saiyan 2 however he did transform into a Super Saiyan 2 prior to the World Tournament in order to fight Broly. But as an adult, Gohan was weaker than when he fought Cell as a Super Saiyan 2 due to his lack of training. But after training with the Z sword as an adult his power greatly increased Supreme Kai thought he could beat Majin Buu. When they tested the Z sword Gohan without transforming had the power to break it. Gohan is stronger than when he fought Cell after training with the Z sword. After training with the Z sword it is believed that Gohan is as strong as Super Saiyan 2 Goku and Majin Vegeta. Gohan could only access his true power when angered if he were angered like when fighting Cell Goku said Gohan could beat anyone. Like in all Super Saiyans forms, Gohan's physical attributes are increased dramatically and his power exceeds the previous Super Saiyan form greatly. The appearance of a Super Saiyan 2 are larger muscles to the previous form, the user's hair stands straighter with fewer bangs of hair hanging over the forehead and the hair increases slightly in length and has a more golden color, blue electrical arcs occasionally appear (and are more prominent when the user powers up), and he has a bigger golden aura. Gohan's personality also changes from his previous forms since his face remains stern. The user's personality is more arrogant and confident. Also, the user is more likely to ignore advice from others and has a tendency to display their superior power by showing off. Gohan has displayed a hidden power since childhood and the hidden power is responsible for Gohan's ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 2 however, it is unknown if Gohan masters this form. Goku has said (talking in his head) I am proud of you son you mastered your power now use it but it's unknown what he meant whether he mastered or just has the power. Gohan has hidden powers and the reason for his hidden power is that he is a hybrid Saiyan/Human which was theorized to be more powerful than pure-blooded Saiyans. But Gohan's true power as a Super Saiyan 1 and 2 could only be used through anger until he got his mystic form.</p><h4>Mystic or Ultimate Gohan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4862305\" data-ratio=\"0.5595703125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4862305\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Mystic or Ultimate Gohan is not a transformation such as the Super Saiyan or Super Saiyan 2. It is Gohan's full power and potential unlocked in his base form. This is revealed when Elder Kai performs a ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent abilities. When in the Mystic state, Gohan is unable to transform into a Super Saiyan nor Super Saiyan 2 as his full power is already unlocked and he is in his normal form and possesses overall power far greater than the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. But it is shown in Battle Of Gods that Gohan can go Super Saiyan multiplying his Mystic (Ultimate) Gohan power. His appearance is slightly different to his normal form though he does not gain golden hair, blue eyes or golden auras, his hair is slightly longer, stands straighter with fewer bangs of hair hanging over the forehead and the hair seems sharper, his muscles become slightly bulkier and increase slightly, he has a white flame-like aura sometimes with lightning and his personality is changed. His personality is much more confident and arrogant in contrast to the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2 forms and the user often grins when displaying or showing off his power and is most likely to show off or display his superior power to his opponent and might brag about his power during a battle. It has been claimed that in this form, Gohan is not only stronger than a Super Saiyan 3 but that he is also the strongest non-fused fighter in the Dragon Ball Z series. Gohan is more powerful than Gotenks. Gohan can go super saiyan in the movie Battle Of Gods. Frieza also stated that Gohan could destroy his army but instead uses non-lethal attacks. Gohan's power is said to be on par with Super Buu (Gotenks and Piccolo absorbed) but was outclassed due to the unique skills of Super Buu (Gotenks and Piccolo absorbed).</p><h3>Techniques</h3><p>Leave My Daddy Alone! - This is a move that Gohan used when he was angered at Raditz hurting his father. He powers up a yellow fiery aura and dashes towards his opponent and rams them with his head.</p><p>Masenko - Is a move that he learned from Piccolo where he lifts both of his hands up, creates a yellow blast made of energy, and fires it at his opponent.</p><p>Father-Son Kamehameha - Gohan uses his energy to power up an incredibly powerful Kamehameha and launches it at his opponent with the help of his father. Gohan used this attack to destroy Cell after Goku aided him and Vegeta's distraction.</p><p>Super Kamehameha - Gohan is able to use a more powerful version of the Kamehameha.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Gohan appears in most DBZ movies and almost all video games.</p><h3>Movie Appearances</h3><p>Gohan appears in most DB movies and he is given a big role in Bojack Unbound and Broly: Second Coming.</p><h3>Video Game Appearances</h3><p>Gohan appears in almost all video games since he is one of the main characters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

            "description": "<h2><span id=\"Origin\">Origin</span></h2><p>In the Dwapar Yuga, demons ruled over the world with terror and chaos. Their leader, Khunkhara was a cruel and powerful demon who sought to displace gods as the deities of the Earth. He killed countless humans and gods alike by destroying cities and empires, with numerous brutal acts, thereby establishing himself as the most terrifying and feared being on earth. The Hrishi-Munies were also victimised, as their Yagyas were always interrupted by the demons. Hrishi Taptamukhi, a highly-respected Muni, determined to remove the demons from the face of the earth, started a yagya to request the Gods to send them the one who will cleanse earth from the dirt of evil. Out of this yagya, appeared 7 mystical beings and at last, Gojo. He ordered the 7 mystical beings who appeared before him to enter his body. From there, he embarked on his journey to fight and destroy evil, and restore peace. On his journey, Gojo fought the spider-like Mankat Demons, who were attacking a nearby city defeating them with ease. Their leader, Mankot forfeited to the might of Gojo. Mankot, who felt a change of heart after this fight, offered to become his ride forever, and to help him in his quest of fighting evil. Gojo, along with his new friend then faced the leader of the demons, Khunkhara. After a long and hefty battle, Gojo finally succeeded in killing Khunkhara. Although the demon Chief was killed, Gojo's objective was not completed, to eliminate evil for once and for all. Thus he resumed his journey of fighting evil, along with the 7 Mystical beings and his trusted friend/ride Mankot. Since then, he has risked his life and challenged evil numerous times to meet the goal for which he was born.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=\"Powers_and_abilities\">Powers and abilities</span></h2><p>Gojo's body is the host for 7 mystical beings who were created from the same yagya out of which Gojo was formed.

She is the only female among the seven.</li><li><i>Teesri Aankh</i>: A being with an additional eye on his forehead,similar to the Hindu god Shiva.His \"third eye\" is known to wreak havok on evil when opened.</li><li><i>Sanharak</i>: Sanharak's body is fully composed of a stone-like substance,which grants him super-human strength and durability.</li><li><i>Shaakaal</i>: He is a humnoid with eagle-like physiology.

He also has enhanced vision,razor-sharp claws and beak,and can control eagles.</li><li><i>Gurughantaal</i>: A being with spiked-body, Gurughantaal can create(or summon) any object,including weapons of his choice out of nowhere.</li><li><i>Billoura</i>: Billoura has cat-like physiology, which grants him super-human agility, reflexes, speed, balance, and coordination, enhanced senses, razor-sharp claws, and fangs.

Enraged by the death of Krillin, Goku transforms into his <a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan</a> form, which turns the tide of the battle in his favor. Ultimately, he defeats Frieza. He leaves the planet in a Ginyu Force ship, which takes him to the planet Yardrat. His friends back on Earth believe him to be dead, but later learn he is alive when they attempt to resurrect him. He declines to return to Earth and remains on Yardrat for some time more, learning the skill of Instant Transmission while there.</p><h3>Android Saga</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082426\" data-ratio=\"0.56255247691016\" data-width=\"1191\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1191px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082426\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 1191w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 1191w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11132/111320022/6082426-dragon-ballz-kai-.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Returning to Earth after two years, Goku encounters <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a>, the son of Bulma and Vegeta from the future. The boy warns him about future events, and provides him with a cure for a virus he will contract in the near future. He and his friends spend three years training for the arrival of two androids, <a href=\"/android-19/4005-40813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40813\">Android 19</a> and <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">Android 20</a>. When they arrive Goku is unable to fight at full strength due to the sudden onset of the virus he was warned of. He is taken from the battlefield to be cured of the virus. He is hunted by the artificial beings android 18 , 17 and the newly awakened 16 of whom were created to destroy Goku. At this time a new villain rises, named <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a> . Cell absorbs both 17 and 18. At this time Goku's heart virus is also cured. Goku, Gohan, Vegeta and Trunks travel to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to undergo intense training; there, Gohan is revealed to be potentially more powerful than Goku. They emerge from the chamber and Goku begins preparing to battle Cell, as well as getting a new Guardian of Earth, <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a>, to create new Dragon Balls so that he can set right what Cell has put wrong. At the Cell Games, Goku battles Cell at full strength, but finds himself unable to defeat his opponent. He cedes the match, trusting Gohan to defeat Cell. Gohan does so, and Cell attempts to self-destruct and destroy the planet as revenge. Goku steps in and uses Instant Transmission to transport both of them to King Kai's planet , resulting in both his and Cell's deaths as well as King Kai's. Cell manages to resurrect himself, and Goku, trapped in the Other World, encourages Gohan to fight him. After Cell is finally completely destroyed, Goku insists he be allowed to remain dead, since he believes that all the troubles on Earth were caused due to him .</p><h3>Majin Buu Saga</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082427\" data-ratio=\"0.59450171821306\" data-width=\"291\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 291px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082427\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-width=\"291\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg 291w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082427-download%20%283%29.jpg 291w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-width=\"291\"></noscript></a></figure><p>He returns to Earth for a brief period seven years later to participate in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. There, he meets his youngest son, <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten</a>, and becomes embroiled in defeating the evil wizard <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>, who orchestrates the theft of Gohan's Super Saiyan energy. They attack Babidi's ship, and Babidi possesses Vegeta, then sets Vegeta and Goku to fighting one another. The pair fight for some time before Goku attempts to halt the fight so that they can team up to defeat Babidi's monster, <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>. He is knocked unconscious by Vegeta, who then abandons him. He seeks healing from Dende and teleports all his friends to himself, teaching Trunks and Goten how to perform the Fusion Dance, which will combine them into a far more powerful being. Goku then fights Majin Buu, using his powerful Super Saiyan 3 form. He easily holds his own against the monster, but does not defeat it. The strain of maintaining the form forces him to return to the Other World. There, he observes the fight between Majin Buu and the newly-created <a href=\"/gotenks/4005-51122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51122\">Gotenks</a> via a crystal globe. Gotenks performs well, but is ultimately unable to defeat the monster and is absorbed into it, as is Gohan. Goku is returned to Earth by the sacrifice of a friend. He and Vegeta fuse to become <a href=\"/vegito/4005-45788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45788\">Vegito</a>, easily defeating the monster. Vegito allows itself to be absorbed into the monster to rescue its friends and family. After a brief battle, it succeeds and Vegeta and Goku return to their normal bodies. Majin Buu is forced to transform back into its original form, Kid Buu. Kid Buu destroys the planet, briefly killing most inhabitants, though they are soon restored. Goku fights Kid Buu, and gathers energy from most sentient beings around him (using the Genki Dama Technique) to destroy Kid Buu.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p><strong>Senzu Bean: </strong>Senzu Beans are grown in Korin Tower. When eaten you are healed of all injury's and can keep a person full for up to 10 days. However if you eat to many it can be dangerous. The effects are immediate. Yajirobe has said that Senzu Beans taste like fish. Senzu Beans can heal fatal wounds such as Yamcha's impaled torso.</p><p><strong>Training Gi: </strong>Goku trains with weighted clothes sometimes, and fights wearing a training gi. Many of Goku's training suits are normally martial arts gi that are orange (sometimes Battle Suits like Vegeta's suits). All these clothes are incredibly durable and light (except for the weighted clothes).</p><p><strong>Flying Nimbus: </strong>Goku has a flying cloud named Nimbus that only the pure of heart can ride it was given to him by Master Roshi when Goku was a little kid.</p><p><strong>Power Pole: </strong>Goku has a magic pole that can expand to any length and it can retract Goku uses this a lot through out the Dragon Ball series.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a Saiyan, Goku possesses all the powers inherent to his race. He is superhumanly strong and durable, and possesses enhanced speed and reflexes. He can undergo Saiyan transformations that multiply his power greatly, the first by 50, second by 100, and the third transformation Goku's power is increased by 4x Super Saiyan 2 giving him a multiplier of 400 and the anime only transformation Super Saiyan 4 multiples his power by an unknown amount, but it is greater than Super Saiyan 3's multiplier. Goku has been known to take every possible advanced Saiyan form unlike Vegeta and Gohan who only reached Super Saiyan 2. However, it is speculated that since Gotenks reached Super Saiyan 3, Goten and Trunks both acquired the form, but for now they cannot handle the strain of the form, being very young.</p><p>Goku can generate energy blasts from an inner energy called ki, notably in the form of the Kamehameha Wave. He can teleport anywhere he wants instantly via Instant Transmission. He is capable of unaided flight, and was capable of aided flight through the use of a small flying cloud called the <a href=\"/flying-nimbus-kintoun/4055-56022/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56022\">Flying Nimbus</a> only those with pure hearts can ride the cloud. He is capable of transforming into a Great Ape when he is looking at the moon and possesses his tail. However Goku lost his tail in Dragon Ball. Every time Goku revives from a serious injury or intense battle, he gets more powerful. Goku is incredibly powerful.</p><p>Goku can endure taking a planet destroying Ki blast as seen when he was battling Frieza. In DragonBall Z, we also see Trunks take a Supernova attack from Mecha Freiza as a Super Saiyan, lifting it with one hand and throwing it away, so we can assume Goku is just as capable, since he is more powerful than Trunks.</p><p>Goku is displayed as being able to lift/carry at least 160 tons without transforming, although the limit may be higher. Goku has also been seen training with 10 tons on each arm and leg, while kicking and punching at super-speed, while in his Super Saiyan form. Since he was in \"afterworld\" training with King Kai at the time, he was also under 10x earth gravity, making the effective training weights equal 100 tons on each arm and leg, 400 tons in total. Without using his chi-boosting ability, Goku can lift/press more than 200 tons with minimal effort. In his Super Saiyan 1 form, he is at least capable of lifting/pressing at least 10,000 tons. At the end of Dragon Ball GT, Goku achieves the final Super Saiyan form the Super Saiyan 4 and can lift over 1,600,000 tons , and the upper limits of his strength capacity are unknown.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5205590\" data-ratio=\"0.51652574942352\" data-width=\"1301\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1301px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.7%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5205590\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.png 1301w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.png 1301w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key%20based%20constructs.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Goku apart from being able to manipulate ki to create destructive ki blasts also can create ki energy based constructs. Goku is shown creating significant energy based construct while he was fighting Beerus in Dragon ball Super. Goku and Beerus later in that fight absorbed the ki from their construct and continued to clash.</p><p><strong>Telepathy</strong></p><p>That is right, Goku can also read minds. He is first seen using this ability when reading Krillin's mind in Namek.</p><p><strong>Self-healing: </strong>After being critically wounded by Beerus, God Goku manages to heal himself while sinking underwater. It is not known whether Goku can use this ability consciously.</p><h2>Techniques</h2><ul><li><b>Afterimage Technique:</b> A typical distraction technique where through a short burst of speed Goku is able to leave an afterimage of his body behind. This often causes the opponent to attack leaving them open for an attack normally from behind or above. Goku as a child in the 21st World Martial Arts tournament could leave 3 images behind, but by the time of the cell games Goku can leave an innumerable number of afterimages behind.</li><li><b>Continuous Kamehameha:</b> Goku's version of the Continuous Energy Volley where Goku fires many small blasts of energy in rapid succession in order to cause great damage. The technique has the downside of leaving a large smokescreen from the explosions so if the attack fails it often gives the enemy a sneak attack.</li><li><strong>Ki Sense: </strong>Goku can sense other people's Ki. He can also tell how some one is based off there power. Goku has been shown to follow entire battles (who is winning or losing) just sensing the Ki of everyone fighting. And can tell who someone is by there Ki. Goku's Ki sense is stronger than others thanks to his Instant Transmission.</li><li><b>Crazy Fist:</b> A technique Goku came up with on the fly to counter <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Jackie Chun</a>'s Drunken Fist technique. Goku hops around like a monkey giving him an air of unpredictability and uses his tail more (this was used in the DragonBall seasons when he was still a boy).</li><li><b>Destructo Disk:</b> A technique taken from <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a> where Goku forms a flat energy disk that can cut through most objects and enemies. Due to the lethal nature of the attack Goku only uses it when absolutely necessary, like cutting off <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>'s tail when he transformed.</li><li><b>Dragon Fist:</b> One of Goku's ultimate techniques and the only one he created himself. Goku charges his fist with a golden ki dragon that resembles Shenron and punches the opponent resulting in the dragon either devouring or impaling the opponent. This move is easily Goku's most powerful move besides the spirit bomb as he was able to blast a hole in <a href=\"/syn-shenron/4005-81731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81731\">Omega Shenron</a>'s chest who was more powerful than a Super Saiyan 4 Goku.</li><li><b>Dragonthrow:</b> Goku's trademark grapple where he grabs a leg, tail, tentacle, or other extremity and spins them around multiple times incredibly fast and hammer throws them typically into a mountain.</li><li><b>Evil Containment Wave:</b> A move designed by Master Mutaito to seal Demon King Piccolo away, the move is very taxing on the body and can lead to death if the user is not strong enough. Goku learns the technique from Master Roshi to deal with the immortal God Zamasu.</li><li><b>Flight:</b> Goku is able to manipulate his ki to propel himself through the air for flight. Goku can either levitate lightly or full on fly at high speed. Saiyan's also have a natural ability to fly. When returning from training with King Kai during the second season of \"DragonBall Z,\" Goku was able to travel a million miles (the distance of Snake Way) in one day by both leaping and flying. This puts his aerial speed at roughly 54 times the speed of sound (approx 41,580 mph).</li><li><b>Fusion Dance:</b> Goku learned the technique from its creators the Metamorans while in the Other World. Goku can perform the dance with <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> in order to merge their bodies to form <a href=\"/gogeta/4005-87268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87268\">Gogeta</a>. In this form they are incredibly powerful. The techniques downside is that it only lasts for half an hour.</li><li><strong>God Kamehameha: </strong>Is Super Saiyan Blue Goku's version of the Kamehameha</li><li><b>x10 God Kamehameha: </b>Is Super Saiyan Blue Goku's God Kamehameha multiplied by 10x while using Kaioken as a power booster.</li><li><b>Hasshu-Ken:</b> A technique copied and improved from King Chappa where Goku moves his arms so fast it appears he has eight arms for combat. This was used to counter Tien's Four Witches technique.</li><li><b>Homing Energy Wave:</b> Goku can fire an energy wave that tracks and homes in on his opponent by locking onto their energy signature.</li><li><b>Instant Transmission:</b> A technique that Goku learned from the Yardrats after his battle with Frieza. Goku typically places two fingers on his forehead and senses a ki signature and the instantly teleports to that location. The technique requires concentration so Goku can be interrupted or stopped by pressing the attack but Goku has overcome this and can use it in battles. Goku is the only one who can perform this technique. Goku can use the technique in fights such as when he fought cell.</li><li><strong>Instant Transmission Kamehameha:</strong> Goku powers up a Kamehameha then he uses the IT technique to teleport near the surprised opponent and blast them.</li><li><b>Janken Fist:</b> Goku's original signature technique that was taught to him by his <a href=\"/grandpa-gohan/4005-60657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60657\">Grandpa Gohan</a>. Gokku calls out the name of the attack and delivers either a punch (rock), slap (paper), or eye poke (scissors).</li><li><b>Kiai:</b> An invisible energy wave that is often used to defeat and demoralize weaker opponents or cancel out attacks without using too much energy. Goku used this to defeat <a href=\"/chi-chi/4005-40807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40807\">Chi-Chi</a> and to cancel out <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>'s Break Cannon.</li><li><b>Kaio-ken</b> (Pronounced\"KAI-o-ken\"): One of Goku's signature techniques that was taught to him by King Kai. King Kai has said that Goku is the sole student to master the attack and that even he could not do it. The technique multiples Goku's ki power by 2X or more depending on how much Goku's body can take. Goku by the time of his battle with Frieza could multiple his ki by 20 times. The technique strains Goku's body so he must use it sparingly. This technique was superseded by the Super Saiyan transformation which put out more power, but put less strain on his body. Goku can combine this with his Super Saiyan transformation to make the Super Kaio-ken.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Finish:</strong> Is a technique used by Goku of which he kicks his opponent up and appears behind them and hammers them. He then activates Kaioken and double uppercuts the falling opponent. Goku used this move on Nappa and Burter.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Attack:</strong> Goku attacks his opponent with some moves before nailing the opponent with a powerful kick to the face.</li><li><b>Kamehameha:</b> Goku's most used technique and the staple move of the Turtle School invented by <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Master Roshi</a>. Goku copied this move after watching Roshi perform it once Master Roshi said it took him 50 years to master it. Goku continued to use it for the rest of his life. The Kamehameha is a blue energy wave fired from cupped hands after pronouncing the name of the attack. Goku can perform many variations of the move like shooting it one handed, firing it from his feet, bending the Kamehameha, and others. This is one of Goku most powerful attacks.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Kamehameha x20: </strong>Goku powers a Kamehameha and activates Kaioken x20 and fires it at his opponent, causing great damage due to the Kamehameha's power being multiplied by 20</li><li><b>Mimicry:</b> Goku has a knack for for mimicking ki attacks after he has seen them performed. Goku learns the Kamehameha from Master Roshi, Destructo Disk from Krillin, Hasshu-Ken, and Solar Flare from Tien this way. Goku copied the Kamehamaha after seeing Master Roshi use it once it took Roshi 50 years to learn it.</li><li><strong>Meteor Combination: </strong>Goku rushes at his opponent with fast punches and kicks before punching the opponent hard on the stomach. Goku then jumps high and fires a Kamehameha at the opponent. He used this move on Piccolo during the World Tournament.</li><li><b>Solar Flare:</b> A technique copied from Tien Shinhan where Goku places his hands around his face and releases a blinding flash of light used to blind opponents for either a quick getaway or as an opening for an attack. He has used this on many opponents like Vegeta.</li><li><b>Spirit Bomb:</b> Goku's most powerful move outright where Goku gathers energy from the area around him to form a positive energy ball that is highly effective against beings of evil. Goku can expand his horizon and take energy from surrounding planets even taking a galaxy wide drain to defeat <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Kid Buu</a> and a universe drain for <a href=\"/syn-shenron/4005-81731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81731\">Omega Shenron</a>. The technique takes a very long time to complete so Goku typically needs someone like <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> or <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> to run interference.</li><li><b>Super Kaio-ken:</b> A last resort move where Goku uses the Kaio-Ken along with the Super Saiyan transformation for a very powerful combination. This move is very taxing on Goku's body as one punch was enough to cause Goku to run out of breath. Goku used this technique once against <a href=\"/pikkon/4005-87211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87211\">Pikkon</a> during the Other World Tournament. This was in a Dragon Ball Z filler episode so it's not canon.</li><li><strong>Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken:</strong>Is a technique in which Goku uses Kaioken in his Super Saiyan Blue form to gain more power. His aura gains an additional red aura so he has red and blue aura.</li><li><b>X10 Super Saiyan Blue Kaikoken: </b>Is the fully powered version of the Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken where Goku multiplies his power by 10. His appearance slightly changes as his hair becomes almost white, his skin becomes reddish and his aura becomes more dense and brownish but with the blue-red aura.</li><li><strong>Super Kamehameha: </strong>Is a more powerful version of the Kamehameha. Goku puts greater energy into the Kamehameha and charges it more before sending the blast towards his opponent</li><li><strong>10x Kamehameha:</strong> This is a move used by Goku in his Super Saiyan 4 form. This move is greater than the Super Kamehameha because it multiplies the power by 10 and causes massive damage. It is red in color.</li><li><b>Telekinesis:</b> Goku is able to use ki to move objects with his mind, he demonstrated this by manipulating a glass of water until Chi-Chi interrupted him. Goku also lifted a pyrimid with telekinesis.</li><li><b>Telepathy:</b> Goku is able to read minds by placing his palm on the head of the intended target like when he did this to Krillin. Goku can also broadcast his thoughts to others.</li><li><b>Tornado:</b> A move Goku came up with during his battle with Nam in the Semi-Finals of the World Martial Arts tournament.

Once mastered the form can be used forever Goku has stayed as a Super Saiyan even when he was asleep. This is called a Full Power Super Saiyan. Goku can maintain this form aura-lessly and use it as well as his base form. Goku was evenly matched with Cell as a Full Power Super Saiyan until he forfeited the fight and Gohan took his place. Vegeta has stated that Goku won't need to power up in fights he can put all the energy it takes to transform into stamina and then only go higher if he needs to. Goku has other form's such as ascended Saiyan and ultra Saiyan or second grade and third grade. But Goku uses the Full Power Super Saiyan instead of Ascended Saiyan because Goku as a Full Power Super Saiyan is stronger than Ascended Saiyan as shown when Vegeta as an Ascended Super Saiyan could not keep up with Cell Goku was equal. Goku can also control how much energy he uses. Goku as a Full Powered Super Saiyan at half power is strong enough to blow up Korin tower and kami's lookout just from emitting energy as shown when he powered up for Korin when asking if he could beat Cell. The only down side is that Goku has trouble controlling his own power.</p><p>Goku Full Powered Super Saiyan is stronger than his regular Super Saiyan because as a regular Super Saiyan Goku lost a lot of energy. This caused Goku to not fight at his full potential due to the amount of energy he was would lose. As Full Powered Super Saiyan Goku controls how much Ki he uses.</p><p>When Goku achieved Ultra Saiyan he was as powerful as Cell but was to slow to hit him do to muscle mass increase so Goku never used the form again. Goku also fought the God Of Destruction as a Super Saiyan God then he kept the power of a god and turned back into a regular Super Saiyan (Goku's body learned from the experience making him stronger) while like this he is stronger than Super Saiyan 3. This is seen with Super Saiyan 3 Goku was taken out with 2 hits by Beerus but after absorbing the Godly power Goku held his own fighting as a Super Saiyan 1.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953388\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953388\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Super Saiyan 2:</strong> Goku's second Super Saiyan transformation.

He used it to over load the monster. In this form, Goku's power is increased 2x times the power given by Super Saiyan, multiplying his energy 100 fold, allowing him to hold his own against Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. While Goku is not as aggressive in this form as he is in Super Saiyan 1, his power drains more quickly. But Goku has trained to minimize the drain and use the form better. This form has no specific time limit and Goku has not been seen to run out of energy while using this form unlike his Super Saiyan 3 form. Goku just has not mastered Super Saiyan 2 like he mastered Super Saiyan 1. But Goku may have mastered this form because he has unlocked Super Saiyan 3. Goku as a Super Saiyan 2 is stronger than Teen Gohan as a Super Saiyan 2 when he fought Cell during the Cell Games.

His aura remains the same as Super Saiyan 2, only bigger and with more blue energy sparks and Goku gains a muscle mass increase making him bigger than his other forms.</p><p>Goku as a Super Saiyan 3 was strong enough to cause world wide earthquakes just from the energy he was emitting transforming. This is the strongest form in the Dragon Ball Z manga and anime. In this form, Goku's Ki energy is increased four times the strength of Super Saiyan 2, multiplying his power 400x its normal power. This form was enough to stand against Majin Buu in his first and kid form. However much like Super Saiyan 2, his power drops rapidly, allowing to stay in the form only 30 minutes much like a fusion. Goku is the only the Saiyan to achieve all the levels of Super Saiyan up to Super Saiyan 3 other than Gotenks (a fusion of Goku's second son Goten and Vegeta's son Trunks) who has also achieved Super Saiyan 3.

Goku used this form during his battle with Baby. He couldn't control the form and thus went on a rampage but later calmed down and became Super Saiyan 4 due to Pan.</p><p><strong>Super Saiyan 4: </strong>Goku's fourth Super Saiyan in the anime \"<em>Dragon Ball GT</em>\" Goku gained access to this form during his battle with Baby Vegeta. In this form, Goku's appearance is a mixture of a humanoid Saiyan and the Great Ape transformation, with crimson color fur, tail, and shadow trim around the eyes.</p><p>Goku's power is increased by an unknown amount beyond the limit of Super Saiyan 3. Unlike the other three transformations, this form does not have a time limit and his body is able to handle to the massive increase without powering time and the form can be accessed at any given time.

This form allows Goku to have the Godly power of his Super Saiyan god form in his Super Saiyan form. While in this form Goku was strong enough to beat Frieza in his golden form at full power. As well as kill Frieza while in his golden form. Goku is also stronger than Beerus at 70% power. Goku's hair and eyes are blue with a fiery blue aura that sparks with lightning. In this form Goku is stronger than a regular Super Saiyan God. This form has no time limit. Goku has mastered this form in the same way he mastered the Full Powered Super Saiyan form. The Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z creator Akira Toriyama has said that on a scale in terms of power Super Saiyan God is a 6 God of Destruction Beerus is a 10 and Whis is a 15 and that Golden Frieza is not on the scale. Which conflicts with Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku being weaker than Golden Frieza because Goku as a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is stronger than a regular Super Saiyan God which is a 6 on the scale.</p><p>According to Weekly Shonen Jump issue 20 Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku has an \"overwhelming power that the world has never seen before\".</p><p>\"Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan\" was given a name change by Whis to \"Super Saiyan Blue\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6481975\" data-ratio=\"1.6506944444444\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:165.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6481975\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" data-width=\"387\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 1440w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 1163w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 581w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 387w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 1440w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 1163w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 581w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11135/111355250/6481975-20180622_142143.png 387w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\" data-width=\"387\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Limitbreaker:</strong></p><p>In this form, Goku goes beyond his limits. Goku enters a coma like state in which his body reacts on his own. This form gives Goku the opportunity to react to attacks without thinking about how to punch or kick. According to Whis, this form is extremely difficult to master. Taking into account that not a single God of Destruction has achieved this form. Not only is this form difficult to master, but it is also straining on the users body. Seeing how the user is beyond help when the form wears off. The only known users are the angels and Goku.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3><strong>Animation</strong></h3><p>Goku appears as the protagonist in numerous anime adaptations of the original manga in both Japanese and English.

Besides having tons of money, Gold does have a natural talent for hatching pokemon and making hatched pokemon extremely powerful. Even with this amazing pokemon hatching skill, it didn't help him one bit with his lacking social skills. Gold is very stubborn and if he doesn't agree with something or someone then he will let it be known. This strong atitude has gotten him in trouble on many occasions but has also in some ways made the pokemon world a better place. Gold is very passionate about pokemon and would do anything for them, he would even go as so far as to break the law if he knew it would a pokemon in dire need.</p><h2>Gold or Silver?!</h2><p>Gold was not first accepted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58495\" href=\"/professor-oak/4005-58495/\">Prof. Oak</a> to be a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55675\" href=\"/pokedex/4055-55675/\">Dex</a> holder. But after seeing how stubborn and how hard Gold had worked Prof. Oak gave him his Dex. After getting his Dex and title The Hatcher from Prof. Oak, Gold traveled to Prof. Elm's lab to receive his starter pokemon. While there Gold caught Silver stealing Prof. Elm's <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57223\" href=\"/totodile/4005-57223/\">Totodile</a>. It was too late for Gold to stop him from getting away, but Gold spent most of the series just chasing Silver around. This competion between the two soon formed a rivalry and then later, through many tough battles with and against one another they became close friends.</p><h2>Crys, Lugia, &amp; the Whirl Islands</h2><p>Gold and Crys met by chance in the Whirl Islands. When they first met he didn't care much for her serious personality, but at the same she didn't like his wishy-washy personality. Crys and Gold had to team up though at the Whirl Islands against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53549\" href=\"/lugia/4005-53549/\">Lugia</a>. After that first encounter they share many adventures together. And even though many times Crys has had to clean up after Gold's mistakes, they eventually become close friends.</p><h2>Current Pokemon Team</h2><ul><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-71521\" href=\"/typhlosion/4005-71521/\">Typhlosion</a>-Level 43</p></li><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-69275\" href=\"/aipom/4005-69275/\">Aipom</a>-Level 42 (Evolved into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-70260\" href=\"/ambipom/4005-70260/\">Ambipom</a> in HGSS series)</p></li><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-78139\" href=\"/politoed/4005-78139/\">Politoed</a>-Level 43</p></li><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-78616\" href=\"/sunflora/4005-78616/\">Sunflora</a>-Level 49</p></li><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-78138\" href=\"/sudowoodo/4005-78138/\">Sudowoodo-</a>Level 44</p></li><li><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-78713\" href=\"/mantine/4005-78713/\">Mantine</a>-Level 28</p></li><li><p>Multiple <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71553\" href=\"/remoraid/4005-71553/\">Remoraid</a> attached to Mantine-Level N/A</p></li><li><u><b>Other Pokemon:</b></u></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-85733\" href=\"/togekiss/4005-85733/\">Togekiss</a> (evolved from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78094\" href=\"/togetic/4005-78094/\">Togetic</a>, which evolved from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-78093\" href=\"/togepi/4005-78093/\">Togepi</a>.

The Elders eventually offered Kala as their ambassador for membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Gold Lantern wears a power ring granted to him by the Lantern Order of the Gold. The extent of its powers are unknown, but it has been shown to grant the ability of flight and creating energy constructs.</p><p>In the 31st Century as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Gold Lantern possesses a <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Power Rangers: Zeo</h2><p><b>Trey of Triforia</b> - The original Gold Power Ranger who was from a planet called Triforia, Trey exists as three separate beings representing three aspects of his personality Courage, Heart, and Wisdom. Trey appeared on Earth to aid the Zeo Rangers against the Machine Empire and at first aided them in a few select battles without revealing his identity. When a bounty hunter named Varox came looking for him though, Trey was forced to crash land on Aquitar. The <a href=\"/power-rangers/4060-46181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46181\">White and Blue Alien Rangers</a> sent him to Earth at Trey's request since Trey needed Zordon's help in preserving the Gold Ranger Powers. Due to Trey's weakened state he needed to transfer the Gold Ranger Powers for a limited time to preserve them. The Zeo Rangers originally wanted Billy Cranston, the original <a href=\"/blue-power-ranger/4005-46075/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46075\">Blue Power Ranger</a>, to take the powers though the Gold Powers rejected Billy. Tommy Oliver, the <a href=\"/red-power-ranger/4005-45922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45922\">Red Zeo Ranger</a>, at the time, escorted Jason Lee Scott, the original <a href=\"/red-power-ranger/4005-45922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45922\">Red Power Ranger</a>, and Jason was made the new and first Earth Gold Power Ranger. Trey had Jason activate the Super Zeo crystals which gave the Zeo Rangers the Super Zeo Zords. Trey then left for Triforia to reunite his three forms though would later send the Warrior Wheel and Pyramidas Zords to aid the Zeo Rangers.</p><p>Trey would later return when the Gold Ranger Powers proved too much for Jason to control and even though Trey had not reunited his forms Zordon came up with a dangerous plan to return the powers to Trey while reuniting his forms and saving Jason at the same time. The team had to reach a specific point on Earth at the exact moment Triforia, Aquitar, and Earth were in alignment. The gambit worked and Trey was made whole again and received the Gold Ranger powers back. Trey then aided the Zeo Rangers one final time in battle with King Mondo by using his powers to make the rangers grow to the size of Zords. Two Years later during the event of Power Rangers: In Space, Trey was seen battling Rita and Lord Zedd on a distant planet and was captured for the Evil Alliance. Trey was released when Zordons death resulted in a Evil destroying wave that purified Zedd and Rita and destroyed most other evil beings in that galaxy. Trey watched warningly as Zedd and Rita skipped away.</p><p><b>Jason Lee Scott</b> - Jason was the original Red Power Ranger of Earth and was chosen by Tommy to take the Gold Ranger Powers from Trey so as to preserve the powers until Trey could take them back. Jason as the Gold Ranger served as the powerful 6th ranger for the season and gave the other Zeo Rangers access to the Super Zeo Zords. Jason was worried his presence would affect the other rangers negatively and told Tommy he did not want to take over as leader. Rocky who took over from Jason as the Red Ranger felt threatened and thought he was going to be phased out as a Ranger so he tried to defeat King Mondo by himself. This led to him having to be rescued by Jason who then told him of his status on the team and has a friend. Jason's body was eventually shown to be rejecting the Gold Ranger Power as it was not meant for a human. Trey would then return and even though Trey had not reunited his forms, Zordon came up with a dangerous plan to return the powers to Trey while reuniting his forms and saving Jason at the same time. The team had to reach s specific point on Earth at the exact moment Triforia, Aquitar, and Earth were in alinement. The gambit worked and Trey was made whole again and received the Gold Ranger powers back. Jason then watched on the sidelines as Trey made the Zeo Rangers grow to Zord size and fight a grown King Mondo. Jason the left the group, but would return in \"Forever Red\" with his original Red Power Ranger morpher.</p><h2>Power Rangers: Mystic Force</h2><p><b>Solaris Knight</b> - Daggeron aka the Solaris Knight is one of the Ancient Mystics who battled a horde of monsters and demons in order to preserve both the magical and human worlds.

Daggeron was released from the cave though was turned into a frog when the Master summoned Calindor who now went by Imperious as a replacement for Morticon as the main adversary for the Mystic Force Rangers. Daggeron was released from the cave though was still a frog. After saving Madison the Blue Mystic Ranger by jumping on a monster. Madison in gratitude kissed the frog and Daggeron was freed of the curse.

Daggeron was a fair but stern teacher. More than once he left the Rangers stranded in alternate dimensions as training and would set high expectations for them. Daggeron seemed to get along with Chip the Yellow Mystic Ranger the best. When Leanbow was reveled to be alive and Korag the Knightwold under the Masters control, Udonna left to find her husband so Daggeron took over as the general caretaker and teacher for the rangers. Daggeron was able to defeat and destroy Imperious/Calindor in a bound battle to the death, but later gained a nemesis with Megahorn of the 10 Terrors. Later when the Master was released from the Underworld Daggeron and Leanbow were slain in battle with the demon, but was revived thanks to Necrolai the Queen of the <a href=\"/vampires/4060-58455/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58455\">Vampires</a> sacrificing her immortality to bring them and Jenji the <a href=\"/djinn/4005-69201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69201\">Genie</a> back to life.

With him usually fighting alongside putties, <a href=\"/scorpina/4005-89819/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89819\">Scorpina</a>, or <a href=\"/rito-revolto/4005-75419/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75419\"> Rito Revolto</a>. Goldar is a humanoid ape, clad in golden armor all surrounding his body. He was one of the few henchman who could actually hold his own against the Rangers.</p><p>Originally he served Lord Zedd, and was very loyal before he was assigned to assist Rita, in her conquest of <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\"> Earth</a>. He led Rita's invasion of Earth, only to barely lose to the <a href=\"/power-rangers/4060-46181/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46181\"> Power Ranger</a>'s <a href=\"/megazord/4055-56317/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56317\"> Megazord</a> after a hard fought battle. After this he became one of the rangers most frequent adversaries, being able to engage the entire team all at once, and being noteworthy on telling Rita what to do. And chastised, for failure by Rita, something that carried over when Zedd retook command.</p><p>Over the season's Goldar develops and intense hatred for the rangers, but especially <a href=\"/red-power-ranger/4005-45922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45922\"> Jason</a> and <a href=\"/green-power-ranger/4005-56670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56670\"> Tommy</a>, due to his constant defeats at their hands. Goldar is noteworthy of the original villains in that he was one of the few who possessed his own Zord, in the form Cylopsis, until it was destroyed by the rangers.</p><p>When Lord Zedd came back, Goldar was the first to eagerly abandon Rita in favor of Zedd, with Zedd returning the wings he had taken from him back to him. With Zedd he still led many missions against the Rangers, but being defeated many time by the rangers, but more specifically the White Ranger, <a href=\"/tommy-oliver/4005-165736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-165736\">Tommy Oliver</a>. While being loyal to Zedd, he harboured a great dislike for Rita upon her return to the moon, forcing <a href=\"/finster/4005-76768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76768\">Finster</a> to create a antidote for the love potion he believed Zedd had been a victim of. He was shocked when Zedd revealed he loved Rita even without the potion. Shortly after this he began working with Rito, during this time in which they developed a sort of friendship.</p><p>Goldar and Rito discover the Power Rangers <a href=\"/the-command-center/4020-51780/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51780\">Command Center</a>, placing a bomb there, but it was fortunately defused by <a href=\"/alpha-5/4005-76762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76762\">Alpha 5</a>. But the two were given a map of the Command Center by Zedd himself, and planted another bomb in the basement, which this time successfully went off, with Goldar stealing the <a href=\"/zeo-crystal/4055-60097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-60097\">Zeo Crystal</a>.</p><p>Following this they lost the Zeo Crystal, along with their memories wondering the city of <a href=\"/angel-grove/4020-57176/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57176\">Angel Grove</a>, becoming <a href=\"/bulk/4005-76764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76764\">Bulk</a> and <a href=\"/skull/4005-76765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76765\">Skull's</a> slave in exchange for them providing food. But shortly after was found by Rita and Zedd and was brought back to assist their masters in their campaign to eliminate the <a href=\"/machine-empire/4060-58045/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58045\">Machine Empire</a>.</p><p>Goldar would meet his end during the final episodes of Power Rangers in Space, he was present during <a href=\"/dark-specter/4005-158350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-158350\">Dark Spectre</a> conference, he was the one who discovered <a href=\"/andros/4005-165680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-165680\">Andros'</a> identity by pulling off his cloak. He was one of the monsters who went to capture the Gold Ranger, and was ultimately purified by Zondon's energy wave.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1995)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/6675364-0292457441-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6675364\" data-ratio=\"0.54229934924078\" data-width=\"461\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 461px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111121983/6675364-0292457441-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6675364\"><img alt=\"Kerry Casey as Goldar\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11112/111121983/6675364-0292457441-latest\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11112/111121983/6675364-0292457441-latest 461w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-width=\"461\"></a><figcaption>Kerry Casey as Goldar</figcaption></figure><p>Goldar makes his first big-screen appearance in the 1995 feature-length film.

This Goldbug is the IDW universe's counterpart to the Goldbug of other Generation 1 universes, except that he and Bumblebee co-exist.</p><h2><span>Major Story Arcs</span></h2><h3><span>IDW Continuity</span></h3><h4><span>Spotlight: Metroplex</span></h4><p>Goldbug and the Throttlebots were assigned to Orvus Base, orbiting Salvvatan VI, to safeguard top-secret Autobot research. Their purpose was to act as couriers in case the lab came under threat, taking the data and keeping it out of enemy hands. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42008\" href=\"/sixshot/4005-42008/\" slug=\"sixshot\">Sixshot</a> attacked the facility, the Throttlebots were the only ones who made it out of the station alive, along with the research information.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2875053-idwgoldbugaltmode_spotlightmetroplex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2875053\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117127/2875053-idwgoldbugaltmode_spotlightmetroplex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2875053\"><img alt=\"Goldbug Cybertronian Alt-Mode\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117127/2875053-idwgoldbugaltmode_spotlightmetroplex.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117127/2875053-idwgoldbugaltmode_spotlightmetroplex.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>Goldbug Cybertronian Alt-Mode</figcaption></figure><p>They escaped Orvus Base but crashed on Salvvatan VI and quickly found for cover from Sixshot. The planet appeared to be unoccupied, with the exception of a Cybertronian-style city with energon reserves. As they were refueling, Sixshot caught up with them and demanded the research information. Goldbug stated they might not have the information, and asked if he would still torture them. Sixshot said he would, so Goldbug ordered the Throttlebots to scatter.</p><p>Sixshot quickly took down half the team, even as they tried to counterattack. Goldbug and the remaining two Throttlebots tried to distract Sixshot and then attacked him. The battle eventually took them into a chamber where an \"intruder alert\" was activated. As the fight continued Sixshot shot Goldbug point-blank in the chest.</p><p>As Sixshot was about to execute <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56655\" href=\"/searchlight/4005-56655/\" slug=\"searchlight\">Searchlight</a>, when the city around them awakened. A giant fist smashed Sixshot, followed by a similarly-proportioned foot. Goldbug and his two companions watched in awe at the city that had transformed into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41831\" href=\"/metroplex/4005-41831/\" slug=\"metroplex\">Metroplex</a>. Metroplex declared his position had been compromised and announced that he was going to leave and go back into hiding. He told them where to find a shuttle and supplies. Goldbug upset that Metroplex was going to just leave, asked him what kind of Autobot would abandon them. Metroplex replied that he was sorry for them, but his mission was more important, and left.</p><p>Later <a data-ref-id=\"4005-63465\" href=\"/rollbar/4005-63465/\" slug=\"rollbar\">Rollbar</a> and Searchlight, who was carrying Goldbug, began walking back to recover their fallen teammates. They wondered how important Metroplex's mission must be and that he must be lonely.</p><h2><span><span>Powers &amp; Weaknesses</span></span></h2><p>Goldbug is able to get up to 1.8 times more use out of his energon fuel. Goldbug is often called upon at times of low energy resources to perform scouting missions. His visual acuity rates tops of all Autobots, he can spot a 10\"x10\" object at a distance of 48 miles. His adaptability makes him particularly important in reconnaissance and salvage operations. His small size makes him perfect for missions that require somebody to go unnoticed. His size is also his greatest weakness. Goldbug is physically one of the weakest of the Autobots, and the easiest to damage. His stealth more the compensates for this liability.</p><h2><span><span>Characteristics</span></span></h2><ul><li><b>Allegiance:</b> <span>Autobot</span></li><li><span><strong>Sub Group</strong>: Throttlebots</span></li><li><span><strong>Function:</strong> Courier/Scout</span></li><li><strong>Alt-Modes:</strong> <span>Cybertornian Car, VW Bug (Toy Only)</span></li><li><b>Color Schemes:</b> <span>Yellow/Black (IDW)</span></li></ul>",

            "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In his earlier years he faced off against <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, then Power Man, and <a href=\"/thunderbolt/4005-13784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13784\">Thunderbolt</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldbug was created by <a href=\"/marv-wolfman/4040-41478/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41478\">Marv Wolfman</a> and <a href=\"/lee-elias/4040-6307/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6307\">Lee Elias</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"/power-man/4050-2700/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2700\">Power Man</a> # 41.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">With the Maggia</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He once captured the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> in a scheme to find and conquer El Dorado, also known as the city of gold. He found El Dorado and there teamed up with the Hulk to defeat <a href=\"/tyrannus/4005-3468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3468\">Tyrannus</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldbug would meet the <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\">Maggia</a> somewhere on the east side of Manhattan and offer to split the proceeds of his criminal activities if he was granted access to the Maggia's fencing network because he couldn't afford to cover his own overhead since he used real gold in his paraphernalia which included his ship, costume and weaponry.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Against Spider-Man</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Maggia proposed a test for Goldbug by having him steal gold from the ESU campus which was being used as a science experiment and would have to give up eighty percent of his take if he was successful. Goldbug promised to deliver and reached the roof of the Physics building where <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> and <a href=\"/dr-morris-sloan/4005-33175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33175\">Dr. Sloan</a> were experimenting on the stack of gold bars. A modified radar scanner from Goldbug's hovercraft pinpointed the exact location of the gold and used laser beams to silently cut away at the vent above the lab. <a href=\"/debra-whitman/4005-33026/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33026\">Debra Whitman</a> heard a loud crash after Goldbug lowered himself into the lab and some debris had buried Dr. Sloan and Peter Parker. Goldbug used his gold gun on some guards and Debra Whitman as they entered the lab. Goldbug hoisted the stack of gold and started to head back to the Maggia. Peter Parker freed himself from the rubble and threw a spider tracer onto Goldbug's craft as he flew away. Parker then created an acid solution to safely remove the gold coating from Debra Whitman and the two guards. Dr. Sloan informed Peter that the gold was radioactive and it would kill anyone who would handle it. Parker swings into action as <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider Man</a> and discovers the barge near the collapsing west side highway where the transaction between Goldbug and the Maggia was to take place. Spider Man crashes the party and tells Goldbug and the Maggia that the gold was radioactive and too dangerous for them to handle. Spider Man fought off members of the Maggia and took down Goldbug with a web-bola. Spider Man removed Goldbug's gloves and Gilden saw the burns, blisters and running sores caused from the radioactive gold. The other Maggia soldiers were upset and blamed Goldbug for poisoning them. The Maggia opened fire and Goldbug fell into the ocean water. Spider Man dove into the water but could not find Goldbug and assumed he had drowned.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Atlantis</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldbug survived his encounter with the Maggia and reappeared years later when a corrupt GI informed him of a gold building that had been disposed in the great Puerto Rican trench in exchange for a piece of the profit. Goldbug needed the money for treatments since he was still suffering from radiation poisoning. <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> discovered the trench with the gold when special presidential agent Charles Anderson informed the king of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> the origin of the gold building. Namor left the submarine when he noticed Goldbug's ship hauling some gold with a large net. Goldbug's craft was equipped with a cloaking device that prevented him from being detected electronically but Namor decided to take action. Namor severed the net from the ship and Goldbug attacked with lasers and titanium grapplers. Namor grabbed the titanium tentacles and tossed Goldbug's ship away. Namor was gonna give chase to the damaged ship but a depth charge halted his pursuit and Goldbug managed to escape.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldbug recently encountered the <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire</a> during the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a> when he tries to get a new identity, passport, drivers license and plane ticket to leave the country from <a href=\"/vienna/4005-44964/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44964\">Vienna</a>. Goldbug along with other criminals that oppose the Registration Act included: <a href=\"/grindhouse/4005-45019/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45019\">Grindhouse</a>, <a href=\"/shockwave/4005-41331/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41331\">Shockwave</a>, <a href=\"/goldbug/4005-32981/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32981\">Ghost Maker</a>, <a href=\"/equinox/4005-42854/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42854\">Equinox</a>, <a href=\"/bloodshed/4005-28109/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28109\">Bloodshed</a>, <a href=\"/kogar/4005-34659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34659\">Kogar</a> and <a href=\"/shadow-slasher/4005-33462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33462\">Shadow Slasher</a>. They would clash with the Heroes for Hire and eventually defeated.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldbug and the <a href=\"/parnival-plunder/4005-23412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23412\">Plunderer</a> are invited to a secret meeting with <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and his resistance by <a href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\">Diamondback</a> during the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>. Goldbug and Plunderer tell Captain America that the super criminal community was afraid they were heading towards a police state and also opposed <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and the entire Superhuman Registration Act. Goldbug and Plunderer tell Captain America that they would back them up if they needed them when they are gunned down and killed by the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a>. Punisher is then attacked by Captain America who knocks him out. Punisher would also not fight back.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Recently a (presumably) new Goldbug appeared, having been blackmailed into committing crimes in order to see his family again.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Battlesuit contains electrically-powered exoskeleton that upgrades his strength.

While incarcerated, Twilight attempted to reason with the three that stealing the wings wasn't right. Goldcap, however, rebuked her and took the lead in questioning Twilight's worthiness and whether or not her own wings hadn't been stolen from another pegasus like Rainbow Dash.

She worked as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/damon-dran/4005-32092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32092\">Damon Dran</a>'s head of security that included henchmen like <a href=\"/kono/4005-32003/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32003\">Kono the Sumo</a>. She first approached Rachel Leighton (Diamondback) and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/moonhunter/4005-27612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27612\">Zach Moonhunter</a> in a <a href=\"/new-orleans/4020-55684/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55684\">New Orleans</a> bar after being tipped off that they were looking for <a href=\"/snapdragon/4005-44971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44971\">Snapdragon</a>. Golden gassed them off in her limo and despite being knocked out by Leighton, managed to bring them into Dran's mansion. Golden also tried to torture Leighton, Moonhunter and Cap, when he went to rescue the two. When <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/americop/4005-42402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42402\">Americop</a> wrecked havoc in Dran's mansion and killed most of his men, Golden was seen trying to escape with Dran on his helicopter. Americop shot the chopper out of the sky and although she was only a few feet from the ground when the chopper exploded, nothing was known about Golden's status until she re-appeared in the <a href=\"/solo-avengers/4050-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3859\">Avengers Solo</a> saga starring <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, this time known wholly as Angela Golden, no longer using the Golddigger alias.</p><h2>Powers and Skills</h2><p>Caprice is well-trained in armed and unarmed combat and while in her Golddigger identity demonstrated such skills with guns and daggers as well as in wrestling. She was also mostly seen as just a hired muscle taking orders from other more powerful villains. Angela Golden relied mostly on her pulchritude and feminine charm to distract male opponents. She also seemed to be superhumanly strong and could have earned such abilities from the Power Broker program which was also hinted at her appearance at the Avengers Solo saga. Golden has also often been seen leading groups of hired muscle.<br />The exact levels of her super strength have not been shown but <a href=\"/dr-karl-malus/4005-3143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3143\">Dr. Karl Malus</a> did state that one candidate using a formula he developed was capable of lifting up to 1,400lbs so it is reasonable to assume she could potentially lift as much but most likely a little bit less.</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>How Wyatt McDonald became so proficient with in archery is unknown, but it is known that he is a brilliant archer, possibly the greatest in his home universe of Earth-712. Early in his career, Wyatt was a British cab driver fighting crime in the guise of Hawkeye, using trick arrows much like many other archers in comic books. He had an on-and-off relationship with his fellow crimefighter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13863\" href=\"/lady-lark/4005-13863/\" slug=\"lady-lark\">                                    Lady Lark</a> (aka Linda Lewis), and the two fought crime in the fictional city of New Babylon for a while. Wyatt and Linda eventually gained enough fame to be invited to join the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40479\" href=\"/squadron-supreme/4060-40479/\" slug=\"squadron-supreme\">                                   Squadron Supreme</a> shortly after the team formed.</p><h2>Creation<br/></h2><p>Golden Archer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\" href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" slug=\"roy-thomas\">                                  Roy Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3800\" href=\"/john-buscema/4040-3800/\" slug=\"john-buscema\">                                 John Buscema</a>, and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\" href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" slug=\"the-avengers\">                                Avengers</a> #85, on the parallel Earth-712. Like the majority of the early members of the Squadron Supreme, Golden Archer was a homage to a DC character, in this case <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\" href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" slug=\"green-arrow\">                               Green Arrow</a>. In addition, Golden Archer has had a romantic history with Lady Lark, paralleling the relationship between Green Arrow and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\" href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" slug=\"black-canary\">                             Black Canary.</a><br/></p><h2>Character Evolution<br/></h2><p> </p><h3>Silver Age</h3>When Wyatt McDonald initially appeared in <i>Avengers</i>, he had little character depth, his only original or unique feature being that he was British. Notably, however, the codename he took at the time was Hawkeye, a name previously used by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\" href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" slug=\"hawkeye\">                              Clint Barton</a> (who at the time was in his Goliath guise).<br/><br/>Later in the series, when the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">                        Avengers</a> travelled to Earth-712 again, this time during the Serpent Crown affair, Wyatt had changed his codename to Golden Archer, presumably because Clint had returned to his Hawkeye guise. Again, at this point there was little outstanding about the character. <br/><h3>Bronze Age</h3>During the Bronze Age of Comics, the Golden Archer started to show a slightly darker side. After Lady Lark rejected his offer of marriage, Wyatt used the recently developed behaviour modification (\"B-Modding\") process to make her love him. However, Wyatt did soon come to regret this, admitting his crime when questioned by the Squadron, and allowing himself to be expelled from the team. For the rest of the <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-3511\" href=\"/squadron-supreme/4050-3511/\" slug=\"squadron-supreme\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>  Squadron Supreme</i> series, Wyatt joined <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4832\" href=\"/nighthawk/4005-4832/\" slug=\"nighthawk\">                           Nighthawk</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"4060-44492\" href=\"/redeemers/4060-44492/\" slug=\"redeemers\">                          Redeemers</a>, expressing extreme guilt and wanting to make up for his crime.<br/><br/><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Joining the Squadron \u00a0</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/187623-56012-golden-archer.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187623\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2323943661972\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/187623-56012-golden-archer.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-187623\"><img alt=\"Wyatt's Hawkeye Identity\u00a0\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/187623-56012-golden-archer.JPG\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/187623-56012-golden-archer.JPG 142w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px\" data-width=\"142\"></a><figcaption>Wyatt's Hawkeye Identity\u00a0</figcaption></figure> \u00a0After Wyatt joined the Squadron, he presumably helped them fight crime on a fairly regular basis (much of the Squadron's early activities are not known), using his original identity of Hawkeye. He was one of the Squadron members present in the Squadron's mansion base when the Avengers initially traveled to Earth-712, and was able to hold them off until defeated by the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\" href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" slug=\"vision\">                       Vision</a>. As the Golden Archer, he later fought the Avengers again amongst the rest of the Squadron Supreme when they were taken over by their world's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\" href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\" slug=\"serpent-crown\">                      Serpent Crown</a>. The third time heroes from Earth-616 traveled to Earth-712, Wyatt and the rest of the Squadron (minus <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6911\" href=\"/hyperion/4005-6911/\" slug=\"hyperion\">                     Hyperion</a>) were being controlled by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\" href=\"/overmind/4005-4812/\" slug=\"overmind\">                    Overmind</a>. Fortunately, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\" href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" slug=\"defenders\">                  Defenders</a> were able to stop Overmind and his ally <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32507\" href=\"/null-the-living-darkness/4005-32507/\" slug=\"null-the-living-darkness\">                   Null the Living Darkness</a>, but the aftermath of the battle left Earth-712 in devastation, leading the Squadron Supreme to try and fix\u00a0 it with their biggest idea yet: The Utopia Principle<h3>The Utopia Principle</h3>\u00a0After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6912\" href=\"/power-princess/4005-6912/\" slug=\"power-princess\">                 Princess Power</a> suggested creating a utopia on Earth for mankind, Golden Archer was one of the many members agreeing to the plan (with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6914\" href=\"/amphibian/4005-6914/\" slug=\"amphibian\">                Amphibian</a> and Nighthawk being the only two opposing). Initially, the Archer helped distribute food around America along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7212\" href=\"/dr-spectrum/4005-7212/\" slug=\"dr-spectrum\">               Doctor Spectrum</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13862\" href=\"/tom-thumb/4005-13862/\" slug=\"tom-thumb\">              Tom Thumb</a>. After that task was completed, he then helped dismantle gun and ammunition factories with the rest of the Squadron. However, during one of these dismantles, the Archer's force field belt short circuited, and Wyatt would have been killed by a rebel opposing the Squadron's plan were it not for the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11840\" href=\"/whizzer-stewart/4005-11840/\" slug=\"whizzer-stewart\">             Whizzer </a>saving him.<br/><br/>This brush with death got Wyatt thinking about how he wasn't going to live forever,    <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/221451-73771-lady-lark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221451\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0075\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/221451-73771-lady-lark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221451\"><img alt=\"Lady Lark under the B-Modder\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/221451-73771-lady-lark.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/221451-73771-lady-lark.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Lady Lark under the B-Modder</figcaption></figure>     and so he decided to ask Lady Lark to marry him, since they had been dating for several years now. Unfortunately, Lady Lark had started to develop a crush on fellow Squadroner <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44491\" href=\"/blue-eagle/4005-44491/\" slug=\"blue-eagle\">            Blue Eagle</a>, and was also well aware of the fact that could she lose her powers (which she looked at as a curse), Wyatt wouldn't be able to connect with her. Therefore, when the Golden Archer did ask her to marry him, she rejected him kindly but firmly. In his rage, and unable to accept that Lady Lark was starting to move on, the Archer used Tom Thumb's recently developed behaviour-modification (\"B-Modding\") treatment to brainwash Lark into loving him. <br/><br/>However, a side effect of the B-Modding that Wyatt hadn't counted on was that Lady Lark now loved him too much - she refused to leave his side and wouldn't give him any space. To get away from her and perhaps think about his rash actions, the Golden Archer ran away from the Squadron without telling anyone. Unfortunately, this in turn led to the Institute of Evil, the Squadron's opposite numbers, capturing the Archer. After severely injuring him, the Institute found out about the B-Modder, as well as the location of the Squadron's headquarters, from the Archer, and used the information to seemingly B-Mod the Squadron. Luckily for the Squadron, it turned out that Tom Thumb had guessed that Wyatt had used the B-Modder on Lady Lark, and afterwards had built in failsafes to prevent the B-Modder from altering any members of the Squadron Surpeme. The Squadron were able to defeat the Institute of Evil, and Wyatt was lucky enough that Tom Thumb didn't reveal his suspicions.<br/><br/>This didn't last long. Whilst the Archer was recovering in hospital, Blue Eagle accused him of using the B-Modder on Lady Lark, having gathered suspicions of his own. <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1613104\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81432360742706\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1613104\"><img alt=\"Black Archer's Death\u00a0\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 377w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Archer's Death\u00a0\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 377w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8842/1613104-eagle.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Archer's Death\u00a0</figcaption></figure>  \u00a0When brought before the Squadron, Wyatt admitted what he had done, by now having started to feel guilty about it. The Squadron then had a vote as to what to do with him, and whilst the numbers were close, the Archer was voted out of the Squadron Supreme. \u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Seeking redemption for his mistake, Wyatt changed his codename to the Black Archer, in addition to growing a beard (possibly to help disguise himself from the Squadron). He then joined Nighthawk's Redeemers, most likely being found with the crystal given to Nighthawk by Professor Imam, and participated in the final fight against the Squadron. During this fight, Wyatt initially paired off against his former friend Doctor Spectrum, saying that he couldn't let friendship get in the way of his redemption. Black Archer was successful in shattering Spectrum's power \u00a0prism with an arrow, embedding the shards in Spectrum's body. Despite what he had previously said, Black Archer saved Doctor Spectrum from what would have been an otherwise fatal fall. Shattering Spectrum's crystal had been seen by Blue Eagle, who flew up behind Wyatt and cracked his skull with his mace in revenge. This killed Wyatt, although his body was kept in hibernation in the hopes of reviving him somehow one day.<br/><h2>Powers and Abilities<br/></h2>Golden Archer was an excellent archer, able to shoot very accurately, even when he or his target was moving. He used the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55833\" href=\"/trick-arrow/4055-55833/\" slug=\"trick-arrow\">        trick arrows</a> customarily found in comic books often. Wyatt was also trained in hand-to-hand combat by Nighthawk, and was fairly skilled. He also used a force field belt designed by Tom Thumb for a short while, but after it broke, he didn't appear to fix or replace it.<br/><h2>Alternate Realities<br/></h2>An alternate Wyatt McDonald is seen in Earth-31916. When that world's versions of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40533\" href=\"/emil-burbank/4005-40533/\" slug=\"emil-burbank\">       Emil Burbank</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13866\" href=\"/nuke/4005-13866/\" slug=\"nuke\">      Nuke</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6116\" href=\"/arcanna/4005-6116/\" slug=\"arcanna\">     Arcanna</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19955\" href=\"/shape/4005-19955/\" slug=\"shape\">    Shape</a>, and Hyperion accidentally travelled to their future, an African-American man referred to as Black Archer briefly appeared.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>On Earth-616, an imperfect clone of Golden Archer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4020-44379\" href=\"/project-pegasus/4020-44379/\" slug=\"project-pegasus\">  Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S.</a> Due to some experimentation with exotic energy, it and the rest of the Squadron Supreme clones were accidentally turned into zombies, and immediately set upon eating as many people as they could.

He'd come up with a new gas for balloon travel. Paul was testing it on a cross-country trip, with his wife and Roger along for the ride, when rival Brand Braddock, looking to profit from Paul's invention, shot the balloon down over a rugged patch of country near the town of Prairie Gulch. When Braddock arrived to make sure they were all dead, he figured Roger would be no threat, as the boy was being dragged off by a mountain lion. But a prospector named Nugget Ned saved Roger and, hearing of Braddock's intentions, kept Roger's continued existence a secret.</p> <p>Roger grew up healthy and strong \u2014 extraordinarily so, in fact, and well skilled in all kinds of athletic endeavors an action hero would find handy, in particular his specialty, archery. He coated his arrowheads with gold leaf, made from Ned's stash, which Ned didn't seem particularly interested in converting into money. Ned bit the dust just as Roger was reaching adulthood, and it was from Ned's dying statement that the young man learned of his origins. Roger dealt with Braddock, using his characteristic weapon as a name (since he'd been raised in secret and was therefore unknown to the townspeople \u2014 he never did use his birth name). Then he and his horse, White Wind, embarked on a heroic career of righting wrongs. When he ran out of golden arrows he got gold for new ones from a secret mine.</p>",

Deciding to use this as a superpower, Klint became Golden Boy and tried out for the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. The Legion rejected him on the grounds that his power would bring down the value of gold. In reality, he was rejected due to the Legion discovering his psychotic nature.</p><p>Years later, Klint's abilities evolved, and his entire body became solid gold. Angry about his rejection, Klint joined a team of fellow Earth-born Legion rejects, the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-earth/4060-52497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52497\"> Justice League of Earth</a>. The League spread a hate campaign against all aliens, using falsified claims that <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\"> Superman</a> was born on planet Earth. Klint used his powers to help finance the team, while putting up with annoying visitations from lawyers and creditors, sent there on behalf of his greedy mother.</p><p>During a confrontation against the <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/4060-47111/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\"> Legion of Substitute-Heroes</a> on the League's satellite headquarters, Klint's gold body was melted and misshapen by <a href=\"/fire-lad/4005-32221/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32221\"> Fire Lad</a>. When the League was finally defeated, Klint and the others were sent to the prison planet <a href=\"/takron-galtos/4020-56390/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56390\"> Takron-Galtos</a>, until they were freed by <a href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\"> Superboy-Prime</a> during <i>Legion of 3 Worlds</i>. Klint's body was still partially deformed from his fight with Fire Lad, and he was later brought down by <a href=\"/ferro/4005-9358/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9358\"> Ferro</a> of Earth-247 during the battle in Metropolis.</p>",

Jack Braun was transformed into the Ace Golden boy on September 15, 1946 when the Wild Card Virus was released.</p><p>Golden Boy was recruited by politician Archibald Holmes to join the Exotics for Democracy, more commonly known as the Four Aces.</p><p>In 1950, Golden Boy co-operated with the House Un-American Activities Committee; he denounced his teammates to save himself. The Four Aces were discredited and disbanded.</p><p>Golden Boy spent decades shunned by the Ace community.</p><p>Golden Boy has super-human strength, invulnerability, stamina and apparent immortality (at age 60 he still appears to be in his mid-20s). When his power is used a glowing, golden aura surrounds his body which has been theorized to be a personal force field. The greater the effort required, the greater the golden glow. After a few hours of constant effort, Golden Boy's aura will begin to fade and he will require a few hours rest to recharge.</p>",

He even passed out cards that said: <i>\u201cGolden Eagle - Loved Ones Need Saving? I Fly in the Face of Danger. All Major Credit Cards Accepted\u201d</i>. His monetary requests were not warmly welcomed and people tore up his cards, thus did a super-hero career get off to a shaky start.

Hawkman intervened, swooped down and rescued the teen. Hawkman consoled Parker and sent him to see Carter Hall, where he was giving a janitor job. At the time, <a href=\"/adam-strange/4005-4604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4604\">Adam Strange</a> had delivered a suit of winged armor that he had recently discovered. Later revealed to be deliberately planned by Fel Andar, his father.</p><p>When Parker helped protect Hawkgirl from the <a href=\"/shadow-thief/4005-31113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31113\">Shadow Thief</a> one evening, Hawkman revealed his true identity to him and offered to train him as a warrior. Parker trained with Hawkman in the suit of winged armor that Adam Strange recently dropped off. There time was brief, as Hawkman had to leave and Parker was left alone once more. However, Parker was allowed to keep the battle armor he trained in. That is when Parker hooked up with Titans West, but when the team disbanded he returned to his slacker lifestyle. It was the events of Charley against the Wildabeast Society which led to his death and ressurection.</p><h2>Vengeance Quest</h2><p>After his near death experience, Parker and his father were taken to Thanagar to become a prisoner once again, his hatred toward Hawkman began. It was after this that Parker started a vengeance quest against his former mentor. For the next few years, Charley Parker traveled around the world, he would even fund his own aerospace enterprise that would later be known as \"Ethon Enterprises\". However, no one was aware of Charlie Parker being alive since he decided to remain as a ghost to the rest of the world for a few years. Finally, one day in St. Roch, Parker would reveal to the world that he was indeed alive when he appeared using the costume of Golden Eagle once again.</p><p>When a bunch of villains from Hawkman\u2019s rogues gallery teamed up to destroy Hawkman, Parker stepped in as Golden Eagle to help Carter. It was soon revealed that Charley Parker had been influencing all of Hawkman's villains to work together to fight and kill him. It was also revealed that Parker had employed <a href=\"/thought-terror/4005-62005/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62005\">Thought Terror</a> to brainwash Hawkman in the attempt to kill Hawkgirl.</p><p>Hawkman decided to fake his own death to learn who was attempting to destroy him, by manipulating him and his enemies. During this time, Parker took the mantle and costume of Hawkman, pretending that he was Hawkman's son due to a blood sample he had analyzed. Parker\u2019s plans came to a halt before he could take Hawkgirl back to Thanagar with him as the real Hawkman returned. Hawkman was now fully aware of Golden Eagle\u2019s grand scheme and the two battled fiercely. Despite everything Parker had done to him, Hawkman left him only badly beaten. With a broken arm and injured eye, Parker was sent to Thanagar in his self-built spacecraft to be dealt with by the authorities there. However, arriving on Thangar he received a pardon for his crimes and was instated as Wingman leader for a faction of the Thanagarian army dispatched on <a href=\"/rann/4020-55709/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55709\">Rann</a>. As Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and Adam Strange arrived to help, Charley tried to fight them until his father returned. It was revealed that his father had given up his plans for world domination, found peace, and hoped Charley would follow the same path. At that moment though, <a href=\"/blackfire/4005-12502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12502\">Blackfire</a> arrived and killed Fel Ander sending Eagle into a rage. The two did battle until her forces retreated. Burying his father he decided to listen to his words, and fight for the peace of Thangar. No matter what. He was later claimed as a prize for the alien Forerunner <a href=\"/forerunner/4005-44679/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44679\">Viza Aziv</a> and forced to act as her sex slave. When Forerunner finds a planet to call her own, she released Charley and allowed him to return home.</p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><p>Charley Parker is a superb athlete and skilled hand-to-hand combatant, with limited knowledge in weaponry. The Golden Eagle armor gives him the ability to fly at great speeds and range in maneuverability. Along with the power of flight, Golden Eagle possesses sharp metal talons on his gloves, which provide him with a formidable assault weapon. Golden Eagle also has incredible vision, which allows him to see objects from great distances, even in near-total darkness. Whether the latter ability is attributable to Charley Parker or the Golden Eagle costume itself has yet to be revealed.</p>",

They were all asleep in stasis pods on Col. Weird\u2019s ship in the Para-Zone while their minds were kept in a magical illusion caused by the Cabin of Horror. This was due to a pact between Weird and Madame Dragonfly to save the universe. The killing of the Anti-God threw off the balance of light and dark. Weird and Dragonfly needed to take the heroes out in order to retain that balance. Lucy\u2019s dad was killed when he tried leaving Weird\u2019s ship and was exposed to the Para-Zone energies. With everyone awake, Weird took it upon himself to set auto-pilot to leave the Para-Zone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, leaving the Para-Zone simply put them in yet another fabricated reality. Gail was a catatonic old woman in a nursing home. Lucy tried using her hammer to bring her memories back, but it didn\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t until she was convinced to say her magic word and transformed into her super form that her memories returned. They needed her help to take on the Anti-God, who was targeting their new reality.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, Lucy receives a message from her father and Starlok. In order to defeat the Anti-God, the superheroes have to disappear again. Rather than kill them, Lucy convinces them to voluntarily re-enter the imaginary farm land, while she stays back as defender of Spiral City.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For Gail, that meant returning to the farm with her lover, Sherlock, where he was transformed to match the age of her body.
